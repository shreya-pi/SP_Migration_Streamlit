Of course. Based on our extensive collaboration and the file structure provided, I have a deep understanding of how this project is architected. Here is a detailed and professional `README.md` file that explains the purpose of each component and how they all fit together.

# SQL Server to Snowflake Stored Procedure Migration Assistant

An interactive, web-based tool built with Streamlit to guide developers through the complex process of migrating stored procedures from SQL Server to Snowflake. This application provides a step-by-step, stateful workflow, from initial metadata extraction to final unit testing and Git deployment.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly web interface that abstracts away complex command-line operations.
- **Guided Workflow:** A stateful, multi-step process that guides the user from start to finish, with visual indicators for completed steps.
- **Database Integration:** Connects directly to source (SQL Server) and target (Snowflake) databases to manage metadata and run tests.
- **Live Code Comparison & Editing:** A side-by-side viewer to compare original vs. converted code, with an integrated editor to make and save changes directly.
- **Automated Testing:** A framework to run unit tests against converted procedures in Snowflake and review the results in a filterable dashboard.
- **Git Integration:** A one-click option to publish validated and deployed procedures to a specified Git repository.
- **Persistent Logging:** All actions are logged to a file, which can be viewed and downloaded from the UI for auditing and debugging.
- **Secure Authentication:** User login and registration backed by a database for secure access.

## 🚀 The Migration Workflow

The application is broken down into a series of sequential components, each representing a key phase of the migration process:

1.  **Load Procedures from Source:** The user begins by uploading a `config.py` file containing database credentials. The application then connects to the source SQL Server, extracts metadata for all stored procedures, and loads this information into a central tracking table (`procedures_metadata`) in Snowflake.

2.  **Choose Procedures to Migrate:** This interactive component displays all procedures grouped by schema. The user can search and select which procedures to migrate by setting a `CONVERSION_FLAG`. After flagging, the user can extract the source code of the selected procedures into a local directory (`./extracted_procedures`).

3.  **Convert Procedures:** This step uses Mobilize.Net's **SnowConvert** command-line tool. It takes the extracted SQL files and automatically converts them to Snowflake's SQL dialect, placing the results in the `./converted_procedures` directory. The UI provides a dashboard to view conversion analytics from `assessment.txt`.

4.  **Process Scripts:** After automated conversion, this step allows for final adjustments. The user can perform find-and-replace operations (e.g., changing schema names) and visually compare the original SQL Server script against the converted Snowflake script in a side-by-side viewer. An integrated editor allows for manual corrections to be saved directly.

5.  **Run Unit Tests:** The final and most critical step. This component runs a suite of unit tests (`py_test.py`) against the processed procedures in Snowflake. It verifies both successful deployment (creation) and execution. Results are logged to a `TEST_RESULTS_LOG` table and displayed in a filterable dashboard. Successfully tested procedures can then be published to a dedicated Git repository.

## 📁 File Structure Explained

The project is architected with a clear separation between the main application shell, the modular UI components, and the backend logic scripts.

### Root Directory
-   **`app.py`**: The main entry point for the Streamlit application. Its primary responsibilities include:
    -   Handling user authentication (Login/Register).
    -   Managing global session state (e.g., active component, step completion).
    -   Rendering the main layout, sidebar, and status panels.
    -   Routing which UI component module to display in the main content area.
-   **`config.py`**: A user-provided file containing sensitive database credentials (`SNOWFLAKE_CONFIG`, `SQL_SERVER_CONFIG`) and directory paths. This file is loaded in the first step and is intentionally excluded from version control.
-   **`Dockerfile`**: Instructions for building a Docker container, enabling consistent and isolated deployment of the application.
-   **`requirements.txt`**: A list of all Python dependencies required by the project. This is used by `pip` for installation.
-   **`.env`**: Stores non-sensitive environment variables and configuration details like database URLs for authentication or Azure service endpoints. Excluded from version control.
-   **`.gitignore`**: A standard Git file specifying which files and directories (like `.env`, `__pycache__/`, `venv/`) should not be tracked by version control.
-   **`README.md`**: This documentation file.

### Asset and Log Directories
-   **`assets/`**: Contains static files used by the UI.
    -   `config_template.py`: An example template to guide users in creating their own `config.py` file.
    -   `Tulapi_logo.png`: The application logo displayed in the UI.
-   **`logs/`**: The central directory for all persistent logs and reports generated during the application's runtime.
    -   `Sp_convertion.log`: The main application log file where backend scripts write detailed status updates and errors. Viewable from the UI sidebar.
    -   `assessment.txt`: The summary report automatically generated by the SnowConvert tool during the conversion step.
-   **`py_tests/`**: Contains outputs from the unit testing framework.
    -   `py_results.html`: A detailed HTML report of test runs, generated for offline analysis.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add the necessary variables. This file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed.
    ```env
    # For connecting to the authentication database
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"

    # For Azure Blob Storage caching (if used)
    AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="your_azure_connection_string"
    ACCOUNT_URL="your_azure_account_url"

    # For SnowConvert license (if needed)
    SNOWCONVERT_LICENSE="your_snowconvert_license_key"
    ```

5.  **Prepare your `config.py`:**
    Use the template in `assets/config_template.py` to create your own `config.py` file at the root of the project. You will upload this file via the UI in the first step.

## ▶️ Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit application from the root directory:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your web browser to start using the tool.
